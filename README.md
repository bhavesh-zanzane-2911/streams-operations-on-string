# Streams Operations on String

This project demonstrates various operations on strings using Java streams.

## Overview

The `StreamsOperationsOnString` class provides methods to perform different operations on strings using Java streams.

### Methods:

#### `getReversedString(String inputString)`

This method reverses the input string and returns the reversed string.

#### `getCharacterLongLinkedHashMap(String inputString)`

This method counts the occurrences of each character in the input string and returns a LinkedHashMap containing characters as keys and their counts as values.

#### `getFirstRepeatatingCharacter(String inputString)`

This method finds the first repeating character in the input string and returns it.

#### `getFirstNonRepeatedCharacter(String inputString)`

This method finds the first non-repeating character in the input string and returns it.

## Testing

The `StreamsOperationsOnStringTest` class contains unit tests for the methods in the `StreamsOperationsOnString` class.

### Dependencies

This project uses JUnit 5 for testing.

## Usage

To use the methods provided by the `StreamsOperationsOnString` class, you can call them with appropriate input strings.

## How to Run Tests

To run the tests, simply execute the `test` task using Gradle or run the test class directly from your IDE.
